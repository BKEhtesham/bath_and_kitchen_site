# Chairman's Message
Starting the struggle of life at a very early stage, I have traversed the tough road to success through myriad experiences and experiments. In the quest for success, I ventured into many enterprises, some of which met with huge success while others were moderate. Through these enterprises, I have come across thousands of people, a few successful and still rising on the path of success, and others merely dragging on with their lives. In my interactions with them, I found that the biggest lagging was in the basic education. While people went through their education merely passing exams for degrees, they lacked in the basic skills of effective communication, arithmetic and over all personality development.
